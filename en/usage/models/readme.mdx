## LangBot Models

LangBot Models is an official model service provided by LangBot. When you initialize a local instance with your LangBot Space account, available models will be automatically added to your instance without any configuration. You will receive a certain amount of free quota to get started quickly.

## Custom Models

You can also add models from other sources.

### LLM Model

Models will be used by pipelines to process messages. The first model you configure will be set as the model for the default pipeline.
